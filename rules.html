    <h1> Rules </h1>
    <p> The Player who's turn it is moves a building troop by clickig on one choosing the amount of steps and then clicking on one of the arrows surrounding the building troop </p>
    <p> if the move is legal, which means that the building troop is not leaving the board, and it's way is not blocked by a toilet or an alread built way, the building troop moves to it's final location, so that all players can see what will happen. </p>
    <p> Now every player can call for a vote by clicking on the button in the middle. </p>
    <p> each player can vote with up to three fingers for or against the building project, but be carefull you loose the voting card you used. Exept the zero finers, which means I don't care.</p>
    <p> then the trooper moves back or builds the way, and the player looses the used way card. </p>
    <p> the amount of waycards is shown in the table under the players name sorted by steps and waytypes </p>
    <p> Each player has a building type to protect, to find out which one it is click on the players name. </p>
    <p> To find out your opnents buildings observe their behaviour carefuly :)</p>
    <p> each building has a certain value visible in the upper right corner of the building, for each building that didn't get build across the player with that building type gets the buildings value as points </p>
    <p> the game ends when no building troop is moveable anymore due to lack of way cards or lack of space, or when all buildings are coverd by ways. </p>
    <p> the player with the highest score wins </p>
